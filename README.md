# -Image-Classification-using-Neural-Networks
In my image classification project, I used deep learning to enhance a model designed for classifying images within the CIFAR-10 dataset. It contains images of dogs, cats, aeroplane, frogs, deer and some more objects. By leveraging TensorFlow, I focused on refining the model’s architecture to boost accuracy while also speeding up the training process. This involved exploring different neural network setups, applying data augmentation, and fine-tuning hyperparameters—all aimed at reducing the number of epochs without sacrificing performance.
One of the key challenges I tackled was balancing the need for speed with the demand for precision, ensuring that the model could quickly and accurately classify images across various categories. I integrated a Flask-based backend, which allowed for easy deployment and real-time use, making the model applicable to real-world situations where fast and reliable image classification is crucial.
Throughout the project, I conducted rigorous testing and validation, continually refining the model to enhance its robustness. This experience not only deepened my understanding of deep learning and TensorFlow but also highlighted the importance of practical deployment strategies in machine learning.
